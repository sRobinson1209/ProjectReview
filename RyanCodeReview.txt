\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 This is an Election System written in java. There are three classes, Node, Election, and ElectionSystem.\

\cf0 The first class I reviewed was the election class. The class lacked a description of what it accomplished which I believe takes away from the code because the reviewer has to have previous knowledge of what the class is supposed to accomplish to be able to understand what they are looking at. If someone with limited coding knowledge looked at this class, I do not think they would be able to follow. On the other hand, the method names are well described so you know what each method's intended purpose is. There are some inconsistencies with spacing within methods, which would be more uniform to help condense the class. Overall, this is a clean, well written class, with corrections only cosmetic in nature.\'a0

\f2\fs32 The next class is ElectionSystem. This is the main class that is used to run the election class. Like the Election class, there are no comments explaining what it is intended to accomplish. Other than that, I don't have any suggestions. The last class was the Node class. This seems to be a helper class with one specific function. Again there are no comments explaining what its intended purpose is. There is a very small inconsistency with the curly brackets in the Node class (line 17) that is inconsistent with the other classes, where the indentation is off. Overall, this program is concise and clean. There are no unnecessary lines of code, or comments. It is also not unnecessarily complex and completes its purpose efficiently. My only critique would be to add comments to the class headers explaining what the class is intended to do, and add comments to the methods to explain what their purpose is just for clarifying purposes.\'a0
